## 🎯 AI Algorithm Deep Dive

### Optimal Time Slot Scoring

The AI algorithm uses a sophisticated multi-factor scoring system:

#### 1. Productivity Score (40% weight)
- Analyzes each participant's productive periods
- Considers meeting type optimization
- Factors in historical effectiveness data
- Accounts for energy level patterns

#### 2. Convenience Score (30% weight)
- Time zone fairness calculation
- Commute and location considerations
- Work-life balance impact assessment
- Meeting density analysis

#### 3. Conflict Risk Score (20% weight)
- Buffer time analysis
- Recurring meeting pattern detection
- Holiday and vacation conflict checking
- Meeting overload prevention

#### 4. Preference Score (10% weight)
- Individual scheduling preferences
- Meeting-free time block respect
- Preferred meeting durations
- Communication style alignment
